# Animal e-commerce checkout redesign

## The challenge
There was growing concern among senior stakeholders at the disappointing revenues being delivered by the e-commerce website. Google Analytics and Hotjar revealed fall-off rates of over 60% during the checkout process. There was a clear business imperative to improve this situation as soon as possible. New delivery options (CollectPlus and International) also needed to be added to the checkout flow.

Development time had been allocated by PFS, our commerce cloud solution partner; this put the pressure on to deliver completed designs within a tight time frame.

## The process
I worked in conjunction with the head of e-commerce and head of IT to define the scope of the project, given the time frame and constraints of the commerce cloud platform.

I began with a detailed heuristic review of the existing checkout flow and analysis of competitor websites.

I also reviewed Hotjar recordings; these gave valuable insight into areas that caused confusion and frustration.

Before designing, I mapped out the possible user flows, and identified key information to surface to facilitate users’ decisions around delivery and billing methods. Once I had agreement from the stakeholders, I began a process of design and test. I made prototypes to test specific tasks and check that relevant information was easily accessible.

This one, https://marvelapp.com/93ga10g, for example, was used for the task, “Purchase the items in your cart, selecting standard UK delivery and paying by credit card. How many days does standard delivery take?”

## Deliverables
High fidelity, pixel perfect annotated designs delivered to commerce cloud solutions partner for development work. These were accompanied by Marvel prototypes to show flow and functionality (see https://marvelapp.com/12h2bd7).
